    <p>When trying to diet down to a lower body fat percentages its important to keep your calories for each meal low reletive to your total caloric intake for the day</p>
    <p>For example my current caloric intake for the day is around 1700 so if im only eating 4 meals a day, I dont want any of those meals going over 425 calories</p>
    <p>This chicken wrap only comes in at 328 calories which is perfect for me. This allows me to a bigger meal later for dinner.</p>
